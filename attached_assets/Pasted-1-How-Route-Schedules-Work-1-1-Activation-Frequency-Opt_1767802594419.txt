1. How Route Schedules Work
1.1 Activation & Frequency Options

When you open the Route Schedule modal, there is an “Activate Route Schedule” toggle. Turning this on makes the schedule active and creates recurring “route stops” for the property. PoolBrain supports several frequency configurations:

Once a week – The default option.

Every other week – The property appears on the schedule every 2 weeks
help.poolbrain.com
.

Every (x) weeks – You can set any custom interval (e.g., every 4 weeks or every 6 weeks)
help.poolbrain.com
.

Multiple visits per week – You can select multiple days (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun) to schedule more than one visit each week
help.poolbrain.com
. PoolBrain explicitly mentions that you can schedule a property “every other week or any number of weeks between visits” and also select multiple days per week
help.poolbrain.com
.

Ends on: Never (continuous) or a specific date. If you set an end date, visits stop after that date.

Once activated, the property automatically appears in the Unscheduled section of the scheduling board for the selected days. Each stop is “unscheduled” until you assign it to a technician’s route on a particular day

.

1.2 Defining Day Assignments

For each day of the week, you can assign a route/technician card. In the screenshot, each tile (e.g., “(Beaumont/North) Mon – Paul”) shows which route will handle the property on that day. You can mix and match technicians by day (Monday assigned to Kyle, Tuesday to Kyle, etc.) to distribute workloads.

1.3 Notes Field

A free‑text “Notes” area allows dispatchers to record instructions (e.g., “Check water level when windy” or “Lock gate on last visit”). This note persists on all generated route stops.

2. Interaction with the Scheduling Board & Map
2.1 Unscheduled Stops

Activating a route schedule causes all upcoming visits to appear in the Unscheduled section of the scheduling board. From there, dispatchers drag them onto specific routes. If the schedule has multiple visits per week, each selected day (Mon, Tue, Wed, etc.) will produce a separate unscheduled stop for each applicable week

.

2.2 Multi‑Day Views

The scheduling board supports 1‑day, 2‑day, and week views

. When you select a range (e.g., a 2‑day view from Jan 7–8), the left panel lists routes for each day. Each route card shows:

Technician initials and name.

Number of stops assigned.

Estimated drive time/distance.

On‑site time (if relevant).

Blue pin icons show how many jobs each route has.

2.3 Map Synchronization

The right side of the board displays a Google map. When you assign an unscheduled stop to a route, its location appears as a colored pin on the map. The route path updates automatically, providing a visual plan for the day. Each route uses a distinct color so you can differentiate them.

2.4 Drag‑and‑Drop Logic (One‑Time vs Permanent Moves)

Assigning stops: You drag a stop from the Unscheduled list onto a specific route/day. This assignment can be either a one‑time move (only affects this date) or a permanent move (reassigns the property to a different route for all future visits). PoolBrain explains that stops can be moved temporarily or permanently; permanent moves update the underlying schedule

.

Reordering: Within a route, you can reorder stops to optimize travel time.

Unassigning: You can drag a stop back to the Unscheduled section, effectively removing it from that route.

2.5 Filtering & Technician Permissions

PoolBrain lets you filter routes by technician, job type, job status, or tags

. Technicians can be limited to see only their own routes or given permission to view and edit schedules across multiple technicians (an option introduced in later updates). In your app, consider implementing user roles to mirror these permissions.

3. Implementation Guidance for Replit
3.1 Data Models

To replicate this in your app, define the following core data structures (simplified):

RouteSchedule:

propertyId

active (boolean)

frequencyType (weekly, everyOtherWeek, customWeeks, multiDay)

intervalWeeks (for custom weeks)

daysOfWeek (array, e.g., [“Mon”, “Wed”])

endDate (null if indefinite)

notes (string)

dayAssignments: mapping of each weekday to a route ID/technician ID.

RouteStop: Instances generated from RouteSchedule; includes date, property, assigned route/technician, and any one‑time override flags.

Route:

id, name, technicianId, color

stops (ordered list of RouteStop IDs)

driveTime, driveDistance, workTime (calculated metrics).

3.2 Route Schedule Modal Component

Build a React component that:

Shows toggles and radio buttons for frequency selection.

Allows multi‑select day buttons for “Multiple visits per week.”

Provides date picker for end date.

Shows a tile for each day of the week (Mon–Fri) with a drop-down to choose the route/technician.

Stores any notes.

When saved:

Creates or updates a RouteSchedule record.

Regenerates future RouteStop instances accordingly.

3.3 Scheduling Board Component

Left Panel (Routes):

Use dynamic columns for each selected day (depending on 1-day, 2-day, or week view).

Within each column, list routes (Route cards) and unscheduled stops.

Each Route card shows aggregated metrics and number of stops.

Drag-and-drop:

Drag stops from Unscheduled to a Route to assign them (choose one-time or permanent via a modal or context menu).

Reorder stops within a route.

Provide filters (technician, job type, status) using UI controls.

Right Panel (Map):

Use Google Maps or a similar API to display markers and paths.

Each stop uses the color of its Route.

If multiple days are shown, let users toggle which day is currently displayed on the map.

3.4 Synchronizing Changes

Whenever you:

Edit a RouteSchedule (frequency or day assignments), regenerate upcoming RouteStop objects for the affected dates.

Move a stop permanently—update the underlying RouteSchedule’s day assignment.

Move a stop for a single day—mark that RouteStop as “one-time moved” without altering the schedule.

Make sure your backend persists these decisions so that future visits reflect the updated rules.

3.5 Extra Features

Notes Display: Show notes from the RouteSchedule on each stop for the technician.

Skip Weeks: Allow dispatchers to mark specific weeks as skipped (not required but aligns with future enhancements).

Technician Permissions: Implement roles (admin vs tech) to control who can view and move stops.
