Build a web-based route scheduling application modeled after PoolBrain’s scheduling system for a pool service company.

Core Purpose

The app is used by office staff to schedule service technicians onto daily and weekly routes, assign pools/jobs to those routes, and manage temporary vs permanent schedule changes.

Required Views

Scheduling Board

Supports 1-Day, 2-Day, and Week view

Each column represents a day

Each column contains route cards

Route Cards

Each route card must include:

Route name

Assigned technician (with ability to change)

Route color

Count of stops/jobs

Estimated drive time

Estimated miles

Estimated on-site time

Expand/collapse to show individual stops

Drag handle to reorder stops

Route Creation

“New Route” button opens a modal:

Select day of week

Enter route name (not technician name)

Pick route color using a color picker + hex input

Route appears under the selected day

Technician can be assigned or changed later

Technician Assignment

Routes are independent of technicians

Technician is assigned to a route via an icon on the route card

Technician can be reassigned without deleting the route

Removing a technician does not delete the route or stops

Unscheduled Queue

A right-side Unscheduled panel

Displays all jobs/stops not assigned to a route

Items can be:

Dragged into a route

Moved via a “Move” action

Show count of unscheduled items

Moving Stops (Critical)

Support two types of moves:

One-Time Move (default)

Applies only to a selected date

Stop appears temporarily on a different route

Original route retains ownership

Visual indicators:

Grayed out on original route

Highlighted on temporary route

Permanent Move

Stop is permanently reassigned to a new route/day

Applies to all future schedules

All moves to/from Unscheduled are permanent

Drag & Drop Behavior

Drag stops:

Within a route (reorder)

Between routes

From Unscheduled → Route

Route → Unscheduled

Drag routes to reorder them visually

Route Optimization

“Optimize Route” button:

Uses map distance logic to reorder stops

Supports optional custom start and end locations

Requires minimum of 3 stops

Route can be locked to prevent tech-side changes

Scheduling Logic

Support recurring schedules:

Weekly

Every X weeks

Multiple visits per week

Changing frequency updates future schedules automatically

Filtering & Status

Filter by:

Technician

Job type (route stop vs one-time job)

Job status (not started, in progress, completed, no access)

Status icons update in real time

Permissions

Office users:

Full scheduling access

Technician users (configurable):

View own routes or all routes

Reorder stops (if unlocked)

Mark stops as completed, skipped, or no access
