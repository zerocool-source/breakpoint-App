On the Fleet Dashboard Live Fleet Map, add the missing geofencing display and improve the vehicle dropdown:

**1. SHOW GEOFENCES ON MAP:**
- Pull all geofences from OneStepGPS API: https://track.onestepgps.com/v3/api/public/geofence
- Display each geofence as a polygon overlay on the map (like the "Crown Villa" example with the cyan/teal boundary)
- Each geofence should show:
  - Colored polygon boundary (semi-transparent fill)
  - Name label in the center (e.g., "Crown Villa (9122.08)")
- Use different colors for different geofence types or zones
- Geofences should be visible by default on the map

**2. ADD GEOFENCE DROPDOWN FILTER:**
- Add a "Geofences" dropdown next to the "All" filter
- Options:
  - "All Geofences" (show all)
  - "Hide Geofences" (hide all polygon overlays)
  - List each individual geofence by name from OneStepGPS
- When a specific geofence is selected:
  - Highlight that geofence on the map
  - Zoom/pan to that geofence location
  - Optionally show only vehicles within that geofence

**3. FIX VEHICLE DROPDOWN ("Find Vehicle..."):**
- The "Find Vehicle..." dropdown should show a list of ALL vehicles with:
  - Truck number + Technician name
  - Format: "#1 - Mike Johnson" or "Truck #1 - Mike Johnson"
  - Show status indicator (green/orange/gray dot)
- Example list:
  - "#1 - Mike Johnson 🟢"
  - "#3 - Eric Gritzke 🟠"
  - "#5 - Sean Darden ⚫"
  - etc.
- Make the dropdown searchable (type to filter)
- When a vehicle is selected from the dropdown:
  - Center the map on that vehicle's location
  - Zoom in to that vehicle
  - Open the vehicle's info popup automatically

**4. VEHICLE MARKERS:**
- Show the truck number ON the marker or next to it so you can identify vehicles without clicking
- Example: Show "#12" label near each truck icon
- Or on hover, show a tooltip with "Truck #12 - Jacob M"

**5. GEOFENCE API CALL:**
```javascript
// Add to server-side API
const fetchGeofences = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://track.onestepgps.com/v3/api/public/geofence', {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.ONESTEPGPS_API_KEY}`
    }
  });
  return await response.json();
};
```

**6. DISPLAY GEOFENCES ON MAP:**
- Parse geofence polygon coordinates from OneStepGPS response
- Draw each polygon using Leaflet:
```javascript
L.polygon(coordinates, {
  color: '#0077b6', // border color
  fillColor: '#48cae4', // fill color
  fillOpacity: 0.3,
  weight: 2
}).addTo(map).bindPopup('Geofence Name');
```

**7. LAYOUT:**
The filter bar should show:
| "Find Vehicle..." dropdown | "Geofences" dropdown | "All" status filter | "Satellite" toggle | Refresh | Fullscreen |

Make sure all geofences from OneStepGPS are visible on the map as polygon overlays, similar to the "Crown Villa" screenshot.
