Here's the updated prompt with royal blue and orange as your primary colors:

Prompt for Replit:
I want to update the UI design across the entire Business Intelligence app (Command Center) to have a more polished, modern, data-rich dashboard feel. Apply these design changes globally to all pages and components.
Overall Design Style:
Clean, modern enterprise dashboard with a layered card-based layout. Use floating panels and subtle shadows to create depth. White and light gray backgrounds with generous whitespace to keep dense data readable. The design should feel professional, data-rich, and scannable at a glance.
