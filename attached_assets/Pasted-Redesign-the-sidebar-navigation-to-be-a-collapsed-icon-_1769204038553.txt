Redesign the sidebar navigation to be a collapsed icon-only bar (similar to QuickBooks) that expands on hover to show sub-items. Also update the main content area to use the full page width.
Sidebar Structure (Icon Bar - Always Visible):
Use Lucide React icons. The sidebar should be narrow (about 60-70px wide) showing only icons vertically. When hovering over an icon, a flyout panel appears to the right showing the section name and sub-items.

Remove from sidebar: Jobs (not keeping), and the separate "Customers" at the bottom since it's now combined with Properties.
Hover Behavior:

When hovering over an icon, show a flyout panel to the right with the section title as a header and sub-items as clickable links below
The flyout should have a white background with subtle shadow
Keep the flyout open while the mouse is over either the icon or the flyout panel
Show a tooltip with the section name if user hovers briefly without triggering the full flyout

Icon Bar Styling:

Dark navy/blue background (match current sidebar color)
White icons
Active/selected icon highlighted with a lighter background or left border accent in orange
Icons should be centered vertically in their row with consistent spacing

Main Content Area - Full Width:

Expand the main content area to use the full available page width now that the sidebar is narrower
Remove any excessive white space/gaps on the sides
Cards and sections should stretch to fill the available width (like QuickBooks does)
The Overview dashboard cards, Estimate Pipeline, Financial Summary, Recent Activity, and Urgent Items sections should all expand to use more horizontal space
Reduce unnecessary padding/margins so the content fills the page better

Logo:

Keep the Breakpoint Intelligence logo at the top of the icon bar, but make it smaller to fit the narrow width (just the "B" icon, not the full text)
