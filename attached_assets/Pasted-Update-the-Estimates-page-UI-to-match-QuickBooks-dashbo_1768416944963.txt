Update the Estimates page UI to match QuickBooks dashboard styling while keeping ALL existing actions, buttons, and functionality exactly the same. Do not remove or modify any existing click handlers, API calls, or button actions.
UI Changes Needed:

Header Section: Add a clean white card header with the page title "Estimates" on the left and the "+ New Estimate" button on the right, similar to QuickBooks invoice pages
Status Cards Row: Restyle the status summary cards (Draft, Pending Approval, Approved, Rejected, Scheduled, Completed, Invoiced, Archived) to use QuickBooks-style minimal cards with:

Light gray background (#f9fafb)
Subtle bottom border accent color matching status
Larger, bolder numbers
Smaller, muted label text below
Cards should be in a single horizontal scrollable row on mobile


Workflow Metrics Section: Convert to QuickBooks-style with:

White background card
Metrics displayed in a clean grid
Green for positive values, red for concerning values
"Last 30 days" pill badge in top right


Filter Bar: Style like QuickBooks with:

Clean inline filters with subtle borders
Dropdown selects with consistent styling
Date pickers matching QuickBooks aesthetic


NEW: Add Estimate Value Filter Tabs - Add two new filter tabs alongside existing tabs:

"Under $500" - filters to show only estimates with value less than $500
"$500 & Above" - filters to show only estimates with value $500 or greater
These should work alongside existing status tabs (All, Drafts, Pending, etc.)
Clicking a value filter should combine with the current status filter


Estimate List Items: Restyle each row to QuickBooks format:

White card with subtle shadow on hover
Left side: Icon, Title (bold), estimate number (muted), property name with location icon, date with calendar icon
Right side: Amount in large bold text, action buttons (Edit, status-specific actions)
Status badge with pill styling matching QuickBooks colors
Three-dot menu for additional options
Subtle divider between rows


Color Scheme: Match QuickBooks:

Primary green: #2CA01C for positive actions
Blue: #0077C5 for primary buttons
Orange: #FF6A00 for warnings/pending
Gray text: #6B7280 for secondary text
Background: #F3F4F6


Typography:

Use Inter or system font stack
Estimate titles: 16px semibold
Amounts: 18px bold
Secondary text: 14px regular, gray



Important: Keep all existing:

Edit button functionality
Send for Approval button and action
Ready to Invoice button and action
Invoice button and action
In Progress dropdown and technician assignment
Three-dot menu options
Status change workflows
All API integrations and data fetching

Only change visual styling, not behavior.
