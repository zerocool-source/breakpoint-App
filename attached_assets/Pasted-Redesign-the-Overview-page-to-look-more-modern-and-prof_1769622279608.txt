Redesign the Overview page to look more modern and professional, using the icon colors to guide the design:

**OVERALL STYLING:**
- Add subtle shadows to all cards (box-shadow: 0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1))
- Increase border-radius on all cards to 16px for a softer look
- Add more padding inside cards for breathing room
- Use a very light gray background (#f8fafc) for the main page area behind the cards

**PIPELINE STATUS CARDS:**
- Give each card a gradient or soft colored background based on its icon:
  - Pending Estimates: Light orange gradient background (#fff7ed to #ffedd5)
  - Awaiting Scheduling: Light ocean blue gradient (#e0f7fa to #b2ebf2)
  - Ready to Invoice: Light teal gradient (#e0f2f1 to #b2dfdb)
  - Invoiced Unpaid: Light green gradient (#e8f5e9 to #c8e6c9)
  - Overdue: Light red gradient (#ffebee to #ffcdd2)
- Make the numbers larger and bolder
- Add a subtle left border (4px) matching the icon color on each card

**EMERGENCY & ALERTS STATUS:**
- Add depth with a subtle inner shadow or gradient background
- Make the donut chart slightly larger
- Add a soft glow effect around the chart
- Style the Recent Items list with alternating subtle backgrounds

**EQUIPMENT TRACKER & TRUCK MAINTENANCE:**
- Add colored left border to each row based on status:
  - Orange left border for "Due Soon" items
  - Red left border for "Overdue" items
  - Green left border for "Scheduled" items
- Add subtle hover effect on rows

**FINANCIAL SUMMARY:**
- Make the Total Pipeline Value stand out more with larger text
- Add subtle colored backgrounds to the three boxes (Pending Approval: light orange, Scheduled: light gray, Ready to Invoice: light green)

**COVERAGE CALENDAR:**
- Make the current day more prominent with ocean blue (#0077b6) circle
- Add subtle colored dots on days with coverage
- Style the Upcoming Coverage list with clean card-like rows

**CHEMICAL ORDERS & TOP CHEMICALS:**
- Progress bars should have rounded ends and subtle gradients
- The bubble chart circles should use: Ocean blue (#0077b6) for 70%, Teal (#14b8a6) for 20%, Orange (#f97316) for 10%

**BUTTONS:**
- "Download Report" buttons: Ocean blue (#0077b6) with subtle gradient and shadow
- Hover state: Slightly lighter with increased shadow

**VIEW ALL LINKS:**
- Ocean blue (#0077b6) color
- Add arrow icon animation on hover

Make everything feel cohesive, clean, and premium. Use consistent spacing, rounded corners, and the color palette: Ocean blue (#0077b6), Teal (#14b8a6), Green (#22c55e), Orange (#f97316), Red (#ef4444).
