Connect the Service Technicians page and Supervisors & Teams page with synced data and county assignments:

**PART 1 - SUPERVISORS & TEAMS PAGE (Team Assignment Popup):**

1. CONNECT TO SERVICE TECHNICIANS DATA:
   - The "Available Technicians" list should dynamically pull from the Service Technicians page/database
   - When a new service technician is added via "Add Employee" on the Overview page (as Service Technician), they should automatically appear in this Available Technicians list
   - Show all service technicians who are NOT already assigned to a supervisor

2. DISPLAY FOR EACH TECHNICIAN:
   - Initials avatar (colored circle with initials)
   - Full name
   - Phone number
   - "+ Add" button to assign them to the supervisor's team

3. ASSIGNED TECHNICIANS SIDE:
   - When a technician is added to a supervisor's team, move them from "Available Technicians" to "Assigned Technicians"
   - Show a "Remove" or "X" button to unassign them
   - When removed, they go back to the Available Technicians list

4. REAL-TIME SYNC:
   - The count badges (0, 18, etc.) should update dynamically
   - Changes should persist to the database
   - The supervisor's "X Technicians" count on the main page should update when technicians are assigned/removed

5. SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY:
   - The search bar should filter technicians by name or phone number
   - Search should work in real-time as you type

**PART 2 - SERVICE TECHNICIANS PAGE (County Badge):**

1. ADD COUNTY BADGE TO EACH ROW:
   - Display a colored badge showing which county the technician is assigned to
   - Position it after the email or on the right side of the row (before the percentage)
   - Badge styles matching the Supervisors page:
     - "South County" - Orange/coral badge (#f97316)
     - "Mid County" - Purple badge (use ocean blue #0077b6 instead)
     - "North County" - Blue/teal badge (#14b8a6)
     - "Unassigned" - Gray badge (#6b7280) for techs not yet assigned to a supervisor

2. COUNTY DATA SOURCE:
   - The county should be pulled from the supervisor team assignment
   - When a technician is assigned to a supervisor (e.g., Paul Fuhrman - South County), they inherit that supervisor's county
   - If not assigned to any supervisor, show "Unassigned" in gray

3. BADGE STYLING:
   - Small rounded pill/badge shape
   - Colored background with white text
   - Compact size that fits nicely in the row

**PART 3 - DATA SYNC BETWEEN BOTH PAGES:**

1. When a technician is assigned to a supervisor's team:
   - They are removed from "Available Technicians" in the popup
   - They appear in "Assigned Technicians" for that supervisor
   - Their county badge on the Service Technicians page updates to match the supervisor's county
   - The supervisor's technician count updates

2. When a technician is removed from a supervisor's team:
   - They go back to "Available Technicians"
   - Their county badge changes to "Unassigned" (gray)
   - The supervisor's technician count decreases

3. Ensure this is connected to the same data source as:
   - The Service Technicians page
   - The "Add Employee" form when adding a Service Technician
   - The technician dropdowns elsewhere in the app (coverage, assignments, etc.)

This creates a fully synced system where technicians can be assigned to supervisors and their county affiliation is visible across the app.
