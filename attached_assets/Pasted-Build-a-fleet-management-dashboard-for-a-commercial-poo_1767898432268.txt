## Sample Data
Generate realistic mock data for a pool service company:
- 42 total vehicles
- Mix of trucks and vans
- Technician names
- Vehicle IDs like "TRK-001", "VAN-015"
- Issue types: Engine Warning Light, AC Not Working, Brake Noise, Tire Pressure, Check Engine, Fluid Leak, Electrical Issue

Make all components modular and reusable. Use a consistent spacing system (gap-6 for grid). Mobile responsive - stack to single column on small screens.
