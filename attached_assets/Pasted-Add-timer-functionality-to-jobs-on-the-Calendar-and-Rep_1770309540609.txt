Add timer functionality to jobs on the Calendar and Repair Queue pages. When a job's 
timer expires without completion, it automatically gets reassigned.

## Requirements

### 1. Timer Display
Show countdown timer on job cards in:
- Calendar page (on each scheduled job card)
- Repair Queue page (in the "All Active Jobs" table and technician cards)

Timer format: "Xh Xm remaining" or "X days remaining"
- Green: More than 50% time remaining
- Yellow: Less than 50% time remaining  
- Red: Less than 10% remaining or overdue

### 2. Timer Expiry Logic
When a job timer expires and the job is NOT marked as completed:

1. Remove job from technician's assignment
2. Move job back to "Ready to Assign" queue
3. Change estimate status from "In Progress" → "Approved"
4. Show "Schedule" button on the estimate (instead of showing it as scheduled)
5. Clear the scheduled date and assigned technician
6. Log the expiry event (for the "Reassigned" tab tracking)

### 3. Database Fields Needed
For estimates/jobs:
- deadline_hours (selected when scheduling: 8h, 10h, 24h, 48h, 1 week, 2 weeks)
- deadline_start (timestamp when timer started)
- deadline_end (calculated end time)
- auto_reassigned (boolean - true if timer expired)
- reassigned_at (timestamp)
- original_technician_id (for tracking)

### 4. Background Job/Cron
Create a background process that:
- Runs every 5-10 minutes
- Checks for jobs where deadline_end < now AND status = "In Progress"
- Triggers the auto-reassign logic for expired jobs
- Sends notification (optional) to admin about expired jobs

### 5. UI Updates

Calendar page cards should show:
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Job Title               │
│ 📍 Property Name        │
│ ⏱ 7h 45m remaining     │  ← Timer
│ [Scheduled]             │
└─────────────────────────┘

Repair Queue "All Active Jobs" table - add Timer column:
| Job # | Status | Property | Technician | Timer | Amount | Actions |

### 6. When Scheduling
When a job is scheduled/assigned, prompt user to select deadline:
- 8 hours
- 10 hours
- 24 hours
- 48 hours
- 1 week
- 2 weeks

Start the countdown from assignment time.
