Here's the prompt for Code Canvas:

On the Calendar page, connect it to the Service Technicians, Repair Technicians, and Supervisor pages so all data syncs properly:

**PART 1 - CONNECT TECHNICIAN DATA:**

1. SERVICE TECHNICIANS TAB:
   - Only show technicians that exist on the Service Technicians page
   - Pull technician names, avatars, and county assignments from Service Technicians database
   - For each service technician, automatically show:
     - Their assigned properties with service days (M, T, W, T, F, S, S) from their route
     - Any service repairs scheduled to them from the office
     - Any coverage assignments (when covering for another tech)
   - When a property is assigned to a tech on the Service Technicians page, it automatically appears on their calendar row

2. REPAIR TECHNICIANS TAB:
   - Only show technicians that exist on the Repair Technicians page
   - Pull from the same database as Repair Technicians page and Repair Queue
   - Show all jobs/repairs scheduled to each repair tech
   - Display job details: property, job type, scheduled time

3. SUPERVISORS TAB:
   - Only show supervisors that exist on the Supervisor Team Management page
   - Show any QC Inspections assigned to them (from the "Assign QC Inspection" form)
   - Show their scheduled inspections on the calendar with property and date

**PART 2 - ADD LOCK ROUTE FEATURE:**

1. Add a small lock icon (🔒) next to each SERVICE TECHNICIAN's name on the calendar:
   - Unlocked icon (open padlock): Tech can service their route in any order they want
   - Locked icon (closed padlock, highlighted in red or orange): Tech MUST complete their route in the exact order shown

2. Lock icon functionality:
   - Click the lock icon to toggle locked/unlocked
   - When LOCKED:
     - The icon shows a closed padlock (red/orange color)
     - Tooltip: "Route Locked - Tech must follow scheduled order"
     - On the technician's mobile app, they cannot skip or reorder stops
     - They must complete each stop in sequence before moving to the next
   - When UNLOCKED:
     - The icon shows an open padlock (gray color)
     - Tooltip: "Route Unlocked - Tech can adjust order"
     - Tech has flexibility to service in their preferred order

3. This lock status should sync with:
   - The "Lock Route" toggle on the Service Technicians page (technician detail panel)
   - The technician's mobile app

**PART 3 - CALENDAR DISPLAY:**

1. For SERVICE TECHNICIANS:
   - Show property stops as cards on their calendar row for each service day
   - Card shows: "X stops", time range, completion status (0/X)
   - "Click to view properties" expands to show the list
   - Color code: Green = Completed, Orange = In Progress, Gray = Pending

2. For REPAIR TECHNICIANS:
   - Show scheduled repair jobs on their calendar
   - Card shows: Job ID, property name, job type
   - Color code by status: Pending, In Progress, Completed

3. For SUPERVISORS:
   - Show scheduled QC Inspections
   - Card shows: Inspection title, property, time
   - Color code by completion status

**PART 4 - DATA SYNC:**

Ensure these pages all share the same data:
- Service Technicians page ↔ Calendar (Service tab)
- Repair Technicians page ↔ Calendar (Repair tab) ↔ Repair Queue
- Supervisor Team Management page ↔ Calendar (Supervisors tab)
- Property assignments ↔ Calendar stops
- Job assignments ↔ Calendar jobs
- QC Inspections ↔ Calendar inspections

When data is added/changed on any page, it should reflect on the Calendar automatically.
