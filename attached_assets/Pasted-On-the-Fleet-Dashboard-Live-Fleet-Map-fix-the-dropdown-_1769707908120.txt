On the Fleet Dashboard Live Fleet Map, fix the dropdown buttons that are not working:

**1. FIX "Find Vehicle..." DROPDOWN:**
- Currently not responding when clicked
- Make it a functional dropdown that:
  - Opens when clicked
  - Shows a searchable list of all 30 vehicles
  - Each item shows: Truck # + Technician Name (e.g., "#15 - Mike Johnson")
  - Has a search/filter input at the top to type and filter vehicles
  - When a vehicle is selected:
    - Close the dropdown
    - Center/zoom the map to that vehicle's location
    - Open the vehicle's info popup

**2. FIX "All Geofences" DROPDOWN:**
- Currently not responding when clicked
- Make it a functional dropdown that:
  - Opens when clicked
  - Shows options:
    - "All Geofences" (show all geofence polygons)
    - "Hide Geofences" (hide all geofence polygons)
    - List of individual geofences from OneStepGPS by name
  - When a geofence is selected:
    - Close the dropdown
    - Show/highlight that geofence polygon on the map
    - Zoom to that geofence location

**3. FIX "All" STATUS DROPDOWN:**
- Currently not responding when clicked
- Make it a functional dropdown that:
  - Opens when clicked
  - Shows options:
    - "All" (show all vehicles)
    - "Active" (show only green/active vehicles)
    - "In Transit" (show only orange/moving vehicles)
    - "Inactive" (show only gray/offline vehicles)
  - When an option is selected:
    - Filter the map markers to show only matching vehicles
    - Update the vehicle count

**4. DEBUG THE ISSUE:**
- Check if click event handlers are attached to the dropdowns
- Check for JavaScript errors in the console
- Make sure the dropdown components have proper onClick handlers
- Verify the state is updating when dropdowns are clicked
- Check if there's a z-index issue preventing clicks

**5. DROPDOWN STYLING:**
- Dropdowns should have a visible down arrow indicator
- On hover, show pointer cursor
- When open, show the dropdown menu below the button
- Clicking outside should close the dropdown

Please check the console for any errors and fix the click handlers for all three dropdowns so they open and function properly.
