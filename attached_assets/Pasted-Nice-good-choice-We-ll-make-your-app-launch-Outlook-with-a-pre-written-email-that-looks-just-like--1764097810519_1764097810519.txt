Nice, good choice. We’ll make your app launch Outlook with a pre-written email that looks just like that Alpha Chemical Order, and you just hit Send.

I’ll assume your app is a web app (JS/React/etc.). If it’s something else you can still copy the same idea.

1️⃣ The Outlook compose URL pattern

Outlook on the web lets you open a new message with everything filled in just by opening a URL:

https://outlook.office.com/mail/deeplink/compose
  ?to=EMAIL
  &cc=EMAIL
  &subject=SUBJECT
  &body=BODY_TEXT


All values (to, cc, subject, body) must be URL-encoded.

2️⃣ Simple JavaScript function you can drop into your app

This will:

Take your order text,

Build the Outlook compose URL,

Open a new tab with the message ready to send.

function openOutlookOrderEmail() {
  const to = 'pmtorder@awspoolsupply.com';
  const cc = 'jesus@awspoolsupply.com';
  const subject = 'Alpha Chemical Order';

  // This is where you inject the text built from your app’s data
  const body = `

`.trim();

  const params = new URLSearchParams({
    to,
    cc,
    subject,
    body
  });

  const url = `https://outlook.office.com/mail/deeplink/compose?${params.toString()}`;

  // Open Outlook compose in a new tab/window
  window.open(url, '_blank');
}


Now just wire that to a button in your app:

<button onclick="openOutlookOrderEmail()">
  Send Alpha Chemical Order
</button>


Or in React:

<button onClick={openOutlookOrderEmail}>
  Send Alpha Chemical Order
</button>

3️⃣ Hook it up to your app’s data instead of hard-coding

In your real app you’ll be building the body string from form values / database records.

Pseudo-example:

function buildOrderBody(orders) {
  // orders = array of properties with name, address, lockbox, items, notes, etc.
  return orders.map(o => `
${o.name}
${o.address}
Lockbox: ${o.lockbox}

${o.notes ? o.notes + '\n\n' : ''}Requesting:
${o.items.map(item => `- ${item.qty} ${item.unit} ${item.name}`).join('\n')}
`).join('\n\n');
}

function openOutlookOrderEmailFromData(orders) {
  const to = 'pmtorder@awspoolsupply.com';
  const cc = 'jesus@awspoolsupply.com';
  const subject = 'Alpha Chemical Order';
  const body = buildOrderBody(orders);

  const params = new URLSearchParams({ to, cc, subject, body });
  const url = `https://outlook.office.com/mail/deeplink/compose?${params.toString()}`;
  window.open(url, '_blank');
}


Your app just passes in the properties + chemicals object, and Outlook opens with the exact text.

4️⃣ Notes / gotchas

The user needs to be logged into Outlook in that browser; otherwise Outlook will prompt for login first.

Keep the body as plain text for reliability; Outlook will still format bullets and line breaks decently.

URLSearchParams automatically URL-encodes everything (line breaks, spaces, etc.), so you don’t have to manually call encodeURIComponent.
