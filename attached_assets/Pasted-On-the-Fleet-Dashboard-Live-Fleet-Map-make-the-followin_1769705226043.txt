On the Fleet Dashboard Live Fleet Map, make the following improvements:

**1. DEFAULT ZOOM & CENTER LOCATION:**
- Set the default map center to the Inland Empire, California area
- Coordinates: approximately 33.9533° N, -117.3962° W (Riverside/Corona area)
- Default zoom level should be around 10-11 so you can see the Inland Empire region clearly (Riverside, Corona, Moreno Valley, Temecula, Lake Elsinore area)
- Do NOT show the entire world map - start zoomed into California/Inland Empire

**2. AUTO-FIT TO SHOW ALL TRUCKS:**
- On load, if there are active vehicles, auto-fit the map bounds to show all vehicle locations
- But keep the minimum zoom to the Inland Empire area if all trucks are in that region
- Add a "Fit All Vehicles" button to re-center and zoom to show all trucks

**3. GEOFENCING INTEGRATION:**
- Pull geofences from OneStepGPS API (if available) or allow manual geofence setup
- Add a dropdown filter next to "All Vehicles" called "Geofences" or "Zones"
- Show all geofences from OneStepGPS in this dropdown:
  - "All Geofences"
  - List each geofence by name (e.g., "South County", "Mid County", "North County", "Office", etc.)
- When a geofence is selected, highlight that zone on the map (show the boundary polygon)
- Display geofence boundaries as colored overlay polygons on the map
- Color code geofences (South = orange, Mid = blue, North = teal, etc.)

**4. VEHICLE DROPDOWN LIST:**
- Add a dropdown or sidebar list showing all trucks with:
  - Truck number (e.g., "Truck #26")
  - Technician name (e.g., "Jacob M")
  - Status indicator (green dot = active, orange = in transit, gray = offline)
- Format: "Truck #26 - Jacob M" or "#26 Jacob M"
- Clicking on a truck in the list should:
  - Center the map on that truck
  - Open the popup for that truck
- Make this list searchable/filterable

**5. FIX TRUCK #26 LOCATION:**
- Verify Truck #26 Jacob M location is correct from OneStepGPS
- If showing in wrong region (Africa), there may be a coordinate issue - check lat/long values
- If GPS data shows "Invalid Date" or "Offline", show the truck at its last known valid location or hide offline trucks option

**6. VEHICLE POPUP IMPROVEMENTS:**
- Fix "Last Update: Invalid Date" - format the date properly
- Show popup with:
  - Truck # and Technician Name
  - Status (Online/Offline/Active/Idle)
  - Speed
  - Odometer
  - Engine (On/Off)
  - Last Update (formatted nicely, e.g., "5 minutes ago" or "Jan 29, 8:42 AM")
  - Current Address (if available)

**7. MAP FILTERS:**
Keep/update the filter row to include:
- "All Vehicles" dropdown (shows list of all trucks with names)
- "Geofences" dropdown (shows all OneStepGPS geofences)
- "Satellite" toggle
- "Refresh" button
- "Fit All" button

**ONESTEPGPS GEOFENCE API:**
```javascript
// Fetch geofences from OneStepGPS
const geofences = await fetch('https://track.onestepgps.com/v3/api/public/geofence', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.ONESTEPGPS_API_KEY}`
  }
});
```

This should make the map immediately useful by showing the Inland Empire service area with all trucks and geofence zones visible.
