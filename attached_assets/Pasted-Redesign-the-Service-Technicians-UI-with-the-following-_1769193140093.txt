Redesign the Service Technicians UI with the following requirements:
Keep existing functionality:

Technician list with expandable rows
Filter by Active/Inactive status
Filter by Season (Summer/Winter)
Search by tech name, phone, or email
Display technician info: name, phone, email, truck #, commission %, properties count, status toggle
Property assignment table with schedule days (M T W T F S S) and season tags
Add Tech button
Edit action per technician

New features to add:

Add Property to Technician

Button to assign a new property to a technician
Modal/dropdown to select from available properties
Ability to set schedule days and season when adding


Remove Property from Technician

Button or action to unassign a property from a technician
Confirmation before removing


Coverage Tag

When a technician is covering another technician's route, display a visible "Coverage" tag/badge on their row
Tag should be clearly visible and distinguishable (different color, icon, etc.)
Coverage status should be toggleable or automatically detected


Scheduled Stops - Side Panel View

Instead of expanding stops below the technician row, display scheduled stops in a slide-out side panel
Panel appears on the right side of the screen when clicking on a technician or "View Stops" button
Easy-to-use interface with:

Technician name and avatar at the top of the panel
List of stops in a clean, card-based layout
Each stop card shows: property name, type tag (Pool), notes, date, and status badge
Drag-and-drop reordering capability (optional)
Quick actions: mark complete, edit notes, reschedule
Close button to collapse panel


Panel should feel lightweight and not block the main technician list
Smooth slide-in/slide-out animation



Design direction:

Modern, clean UI with good visual hierarchy
Dark theme with glass-morphism effects preferred
Smooth micro-interactions and transitions
Clear status indicators and color-coded tags
Mobile-responsive (panel becomes full-screen on mobile)
User-friendly and intuitive—minimal clicks to complete actions
