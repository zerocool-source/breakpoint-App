On the Scheduling calendar, when office staff clicks the three-dot menu on a route card, update the following options to work as described:
Reassign Today — Reassigns the entire route to a different technician for that one day only. When clicked, show a modal with: "Select Technician" dropdown (list of available techs), "Reason" dropdown (Sick, PTO, Emergency, Training, Other), and optional notes field. After confirming, the selected tech takes over all stops on that route for today only. Tomorrow, the route automatically reverts back to the original assigned technician. Show a visual indicator (badge or different color) on the reassigned route card so staff can see it's been changed.
Extended Cover — Same as Reassign Today but for multiple days. When clicked, show a modal with: "Select Technician" dropdown, "Start Date" date picker, "End Date" date picker, "Reason" dropdown (Sick, PTO, Vacation, Medical Leave, Training, Other), and optional notes field. The covering tech takes over the entire route for the selected date range. After the end date passes, the route automatically reverts back to the original assigned technician — no manual action needed. Display the coverage period on the route card during those dates (e.g., "Covered by [Name] until [End Date]").
Split Route — Divides the route's stops between two technicians for that day. When clicked, show a modal with: "Select First Technician" dropdown, "Select Second Technician" dropdown, then display all the stops on the route as a checklist. Office staff checks which stops go to Tech 1 and which go to Tech 2 (default could be split evenly or drag-and-drop to assign). Include "Reason" dropdown and optional notes. After confirming, the original route card splits into two separate cards on the calendar — one for each tech showing only their assigned stops. This only applies to that one day; the next scheduled day reverts to the original single-technician route.
Temporary Cover — Remove this option since "Reassign Today" already covers single-day reassignments.
All of these actions log to the Route History page with: Date(s), Original Technician, Covered By / Split Between, Action Type (Reassign Today, Extended Cover, Split Route), Reason, Changed By (staff who made the change), and Timestamp.
