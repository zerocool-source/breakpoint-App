Build a full-stack “Route Schedule” system for a pool service management app.

GOAL:
A property appears on the Scheduling page only when its Route Schedule is ACTIVE.
When activated, the property automatically generates future service visits (ServiceOccurrences) and places them into an “Unscheduled” queue on the Scheduling Board, where dispatch can drag them onto technician routes.

TECH STACK:
React frontend + Node/Express backend + SQLite (or Postgres) with Prisma ORM.
Use TypeScript.

DATA MODELS:
Customer: id, name
Property: id, customerId, address fields, name/label
RouteSchedule: id, propertyId, isActive boolean,
  frequencyType enum (WEEKLY, EVERY_OTHER_WEEK, EVERY_X_WEEKS, MULTI_VISIT_WEEK),
  intervalWeeks int nullable,
  daysOfWeek string[] nullable,
  endsOnMode enum (NEVER, DATE),
  endsOnDate date nullable,
  notes text nullable,
  updatedAt

ServiceOccurrence: id, propertyId, routeScheduleId, date,
  status enum (UNSCHEDULED, SCHEDULED, COMPLETED, SKIPPED),
  routeId nullable,
  technicianId nullable,
  isAutoGenerated boolean,
  createdAt

Route: id, date, name, color, technicianId
Technician: id, name, initials

UI REQUIREMENTS:

1) Customer/Property Page
- Customer can have multiple Properties (locations).
- Selecting a property shows a “Route” icon:
  gray if schedule inactive, green if active.
- Clicking the icon opens the Route Schedule modal.

2) Route Schedule Modal
- Toggle: Activate Route Schedule (ON/OFF)
- Frequency radio options:
  - Once a week (WEEKLY)
  - Every other week (EVERY_OTHER_WEEK)
  - Every (X) weeks (EVERY_X_WEEKS) with numeric input
  - Multiple visits per week (MULTI_VISIT_WEEK) with day-of-week selector buttons
- Ends On options:
  - Never
  - Date (datepicker)
- Notes textarea
- Auto-save: changes persist immediately OR on modal close

3) Scheduling Board Page
- Header shows “Unscheduled” count
- Show 1-day, 2-day, and week view columns
- Each day column contains:
  - Unscheduled list (ServiceOccurrences where status=UNSCHEDULED for that date)
  - Route cards (for that date)
- Drag & drop:
  - User can drag an unscheduled occurrence onto a Route card.
  - When dropped: update occurrence: status=SCHEDULED, set routeId & technicianId, remove from unscheduled list.

BACKEND LOGIC:

- On RouteSchedule activation or change, generate ServiceOccurrences for a rolling window (next 6 weeks):
  Implement generateOccurrences(schedule, startDate, endDate).
  Rules:
   * WEEKLY: one per week on the selected service weekday (default Monday if not specified)
   * EVERY_OTHER_WEEK: one every 2 weeks
   * EVERY_X_WEEKS: one every intervalWeeks
   * MULTI_VISIT_WEEK: one per selected weekday each week
  Respect endsOnDate: no occurrences after this date.
  If endsOnDate <= today, auto-set schedule isActive=false.

- When RouteSchedule is toggled OFF:
  Stop generating.
  Remove future UNSCHEDULED occurrences (or mark them cancelled) so the property no longer appears anywhere in Scheduling.
