Create a new page called "History Log" under the Estimates section in the left sidebar, positioned directly below "All Estimates" with a clock/history icon. This page provides full accountability tracking so management can see exactly who did what, when, and how for every estimate — including who approved it at the property, who recorded the approval in the office, how it was approved (email vs verbal), which estimates were archived or deleted, and by whom.
Display summary metric cards: Total Estimates Processed, Email Approvals, Verbal Approvals (amber highlight as these bypassed standard process), Archived, and Deleted (red). Include filters for Status (Approved, Rejected, Pending, Archived, Deleted), Approval Method (Email, Verbal), Property/Customer search, Approved By (the customer contact who gave approval), Recorded By (office staff or tech who entered it), and Archived/Deleted By.
The main table shows: Estimate Number, Property Name, Estimate Value, Status badge, Approval Method (Email or Verbal), Approved By (customer name and their title like Property Manager or HOA President), Recorded By (which staff member recorded the approval), How Approved (email link clicked, verbal via phone, verbal in-person), Date/Time, and Actions. For archived estimates show who archived it and why. For deleted estimates show who deleted it, when, the required reason, and what status it was before deletion. Use color coding: amber border for verbal approvals, gray tint for archived, red tint for deleted.
Clicking a row expands to show the full timeline of that estimate: when it was created, sent for approval, who it was sent to, when/how approval was received, who recorded it, and any subsequent archive or deletion with reasons. This gives a complete chain of custody for every estimate.
Implement soft delete so nothing is ever permanently removed. Require a reason when archiving or deleting. Create an estimate_history_log table tracking every action: estimate_id, action_type (created, sent_for_approval, approved, rejected, archived, deleted, restored), performed_by_user_id, performed_at timestamp, approval_method, approver_name, approver_title, approver_contact_method, reason/notes. This creates the full audit trail.
Include CSV/PDF export for audit reports. Alert management when approved estimates get deleted. Link from All Estimates and Estimate Details pages so any estimate can jump to its full history.
