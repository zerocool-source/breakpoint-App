On the Calendar page under the Service filter, make these fixes:

**1. SHOW ASSIGNMENT INDICATOR ON ERIC GRITZKE'S SLOT FOR TUE 27:**
- Add a separate small container/card in orange showing the assignment
- Position it below or next to the route card (1 stops)
- Style it differently from route cards to distinguish it

**ASSIGNMENT CARD STYLE:**
- Orange (#f97316) left border or light orange background (#fff7ed)
- Smaller than route cards
- Show:
  - 📋 icon or "Assignment" label
  - Assignment count (e.g., "1 assignment" or "2 assignments")
  - Or show assignment type (e.g., "Inspection")
  - Status badge: [Pending]
- Clickable to open assignment details

**EXAMPLE:**
```
TUE 27 slot for Eric Gritzke:
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ 1 stops           0/1   │  ← Route card (existing)
│ ⏱ 08:00 - 16:00         │
│ [Pending]               │
│ 1 📍 Amelia Square HOA  │
│ ••• Route Actions       │
└─────────────────────────┘
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ 📋 1 Assignment [Pending]│  ← NEW Assignment card (orange tint)
│ Inspection              │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**2. MAKE ASSIGNMENTS BAR CLICKABLE:**
- When clicking on the "Assignments" bar (or the "4 assignments" badge), open a right sidebar
- Sidebar slides in from the right (same style as "Ready to Assign" sidebar)
- Calendar condenses to make room

**RIGHT SIDEBAR CONTENTS:**
- Header: "Assignments" with X close button
- Subtitle: "4 assignments"
- Scrollable list of all assignments showing:
  - Assignment type/title
  - Property name
  - Assigned technician name
  - Scheduled date
  - Status badge (Pending/In Progress/Completed)
  - "View Details" or click to expand
- Sort by date (oldest first) or by technician

**SIDEBAR LAYOUT:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
