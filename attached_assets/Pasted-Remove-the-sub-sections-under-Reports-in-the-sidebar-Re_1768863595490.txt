Remove the sub-sections under Reports in the sidebar (Repairs, Chemicals, Commissions, Equipment Tracker) and make Reports a single unified dashboard page. At the top, include a date range filter and export buttons for PDF and CSV. Display summary metric cards showing dollar amounts and counts for: Total Revenue, Estimates Sent (count and value), Estimates Approved (count and value), Invoices Sent (count and value), Invoices Paid (count and value), Outstanding Balance, Service Repairs Completed (count), Repair Revenue, Commissions Owed, and Net Repair Revenue (which is Repair Revenue minus Commissions). Also show counts for Chemical Orders, Chemical Drop-Offs, Equipment Tracked, and Pending Repairs Needed.
Include a charts section with pie charts showing Revenue by Source, Estimates Status Breakdown, and Repairs by Type. Add bar charts for Monthly Revenue Comparison, Estimates vs Invoices by Month, Service Repairs Completed by Technician, and Commissions by Technician. Include line charts for Revenue Trend Over Time and Repair Volume Over Time.
Below the charts, display data logs as sortable and filterable tables for: Repairs Log (date, property, repair type, technician, status, revenue, commission, net amount), Chemicals Log (date, property, technician, order type, items, status), Commissions Log (date, technician, property, job, total amount, commission rate, commission owed, paid status), Equipment Tracker Log (date added, property, equipment type, model, serial number, install date, warranty status, last service), Invoices Log (invoice number, date, property/customer, amount, status, paid date, days outstanding), and Estimates Log (estimate number, date, property/customer, amount, status, approved by, approval method). Include a dedicated Service Repairs Revenue Report section that breaks down by technician showing repairs done, revenue, commission, and net amount. All filters should apply globally across all charts and logs, and all data should pull live from the database.
