I am uploading an Excel sheet called "BREAKPOINT COMMERCIAL POOL SYSTEMS - SERVICE SCHEDULES". 

DO NOT change any UI, layout, or design. ONLY update the data/assignments based on this Excel sheet.

**TASK: Assign properties to service technicians with their summer and winter schedules based on the Excel data.**

**EXCEL SHEET COLUMNS:**
- Column A: Supervisor (e.g., "Alfred - Mid County", "Paul - S. County")
- Column B: Technician (e.g., "Rodrigo H.", "Eric G.", "Sean", "Justin", "Daniel P.")
- Column C: Zone (e.g., "S. Corona", "Lake Elsinore/West", "Temecula/West", "Moreno Valley")
- Column D: Property Name (e.g., "Horsethief 1 & 2 Canyon", "Amberwalk", "Belcaro")
- Column E: Summer Schedule (e.g., "6 Days", "M. W. F. Year-Round", "M. W. F. S.", "Mon - Fri")
- Column F: Winter Schedule (e.g., "M. W. Th. F.", "M. W. F.", "Mon & Fri.")

**WHAT TO DO:**

1. READ the Excel sheet data

2. MATCH each technician name in the Excel to the Service Technicians in the app:
   - "Rodrigo H." = Rodrigo (find by first name match)
   - "Eric G." = Eric Gritzke
   - "Sean" = Sean Darden
   - "Justin" = Justin (find by first name)
   - "Daniel P." = Daniel Pynn or Daniel (find by first name)
   - Match other technicians similarly by first name

3. For EACH property listed under a technician in the Excel:
   - Find or create the property in the Properties database
   - Assign it to that technician on the Service Technicians page
   - Set the SUMMER SCHEDULE service days based on Column E:
     - "6 Days" = M, T, W, T, F, S (Monday through Saturday)
     - "M. W. F. Year-Round" or "M. W. F." = M, W, F (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
     - "M. W. F. S." = M, W, F, S (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday)
     - "Mon - Fri" = M, T, W, T, F (Monday through Friday)
     - "M. W. Th. F." = M, W, Th, F (Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday)
     - "M. F. Year-Round" = M, F (Monday, Friday)
     - "Mon & Fri." = M, F (Monday, Friday)
   - Set the WINTER SCHEDULE service days based on Column F (same logic)

4. The property cards under each technician should show:
   - Property Name
   - Zone (from Column C)
   - Service days as colored circles (M, T, W, T, F, S, S) - filled/highlighted for active days
   - Summer schedule when "Summer" mode is selected
   - Winter schedule when "Winter" mode is selected

5. ALSO assign the technician to the correct SUPERVISOR based on Column A:
   - "Alfred - Mid County" = Alfred Pena (Mid County)
   - "Paul - S. County" = Paul Fuhrman (South County)
   - "Richard - North County" = Richard Holley (North County)

**IMPORTANT - DO NOT:**
- Change any UI design or layout
- Change any colors or styling
- Modify any page structure
- Remove any existing features

**ONLY:**
- Add/update property assignments to technicians
- Set summer and winter service day schedules
- Assign technicians to their supervisors/counties

After this update, when I click on "Eric Gritzke" in the Service Technicians page, I should see all his properties from the Excel (Amberwalk, Bearcreek, Belcaro, Madison Park, Ridge At Cal Oaks, River's Edge, Solera At Murrieta, etc.) with their correct M, W, F service day schedules.
