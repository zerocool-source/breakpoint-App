Here's the updated prompt for Code Canvas:

```
On the Customers page, add a Zones management system:

**PART 1 - ADD ZONES BUTTON IN HEADER:**

1. Next to the "Add Customer" button in the header, add a "Manage Zones" button:
   - Ocean blue (#0077b6) outline style button with a map/location icon
   - When clicked, open a "Manage Zones" modal/popup

2. MANAGE ZONES MODAL:
   - Title: "Manage Zones"
   - Input field: "Add New Zone" with placeholder "Type zone name..."
   - "Add" button next to input (orange #f97316)
   - Below, show a list of existing zones:
     - Zone name
     - Count of customers in that zone
     - "Delete" button (red trash icon) - with confirmation: "Are you sure? X customers are in this zone. They will become unassigned."
   - Sample zones: "Zone A - North", "Zone B - Central", "Zone C - South", "Zone D - East", "Zone E - West"
   - "Done" button to close modal

**PART 2 - ZONE DROPDOWN ON EACH CUSTOMER ROW:**

1. Add a Zone column/dropdown on each customer row:
   - Show current zone as a colored tag/badge (if assigned)
   - If no zone assigned, show "+ Add Zone" text/button in gray
   
2. Zone dropdown functionality:
   - Click on the zone badge or "+ Add Zone" to open a dropdown
   - Dropdown shows all available zones from the Manage Zones list
   - Select a zone to assign it to that customer
   - The zone appears as a colored pill/badge tag on the row
   - Option to "Remove Zone" at the bottom of dropdown

3. Zone badge colors (assign automatically or cycle through):
   - Zone A: Ocean blue (#0077b6)
   - Zone B: Orange (#f97316)
   - Zone C: Teal (#14b8a6)
   - Zone D: Green (#22c55e)
   - Zone E: Gray (#6b7280)

4. Allow changing zones:
   - Click on existing zone badge to open dropdown
   - Select a different zone to change it
   - Change is saved immediately

**PART 3 - GROUP CUSTOMERS BY ZONE (Only show customers with zones):**

1. Add a "Group by Zone" toggle or view option in the header:
   - Toggle button: "Group by Zone" (on/off)
   - Or tabs: "All Customers" | "By Zone"

2. When "Group by Zone" is enabled:
   - ONLY show customers that have a zone assigned
   - Customers WITHOUT a zone are hidden/excluded from this view
   - Show zone headers as section dividers
   - Each zone section shows: "Zone A - North (12 customers)" as a collapsible header
   - Customers under each zone are listed below the header
   - Zones sorted alphabetically or by customer count

3. Zone section styling:
   - Zone header has a light colored background matching the zone badge color
   - Collapsible with arrow icon (expand/collapse)
   - Show customer count in the header

4. When "Group by Zone" is OFF (default "All Customers" view):
   - Show ALL customers including those without zones
   - Normal list view

**PART 4 - FILTER BY ZONE:**

1. Add a Zone filter dropdown next to existing filters:
   - "All Customers" (default - shows everyone)
   - List of all zones (clicking one shows only that zone)
   - Selecting a zone filters the list to show only customers in that zone

**STYLING:**
- Keep the same clean UI style as the rest of the app
- Zone badges should be small, rounded pills with colored backgrounds and white text
- Dropdowns should match the existing dropdown styling
- Use subtle animations for expanding/collapsing zone groups
