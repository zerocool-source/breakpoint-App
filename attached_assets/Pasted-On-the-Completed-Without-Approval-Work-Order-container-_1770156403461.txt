On the "Completed Without Approval (Work Order)" container, fix the Invoice button so it actually creates an invoice and adds it to the Invoices page:

**THE ISSUE:**
- User selected WO-26-00001 (Palm Court Apartments - $450.00)
- Clicked "Invoice (1)" button
- The invoice was NOT created on the Invoices page
- The work order was NOT removed from the container

**FIX THE INVOICE BUTTON FUNCTIONALITY:**

1. **When Invoice button is clicked:**
   - Get all selected work orders (checked checkboxes)
   - For each selected work order, create a new invoice record in the database

2. **Create Invoice with this data:**
   ```javascript
   const newInvoice = {
     invoice_number: generateInvoiceNumber(), // e.g., "INV-26-00018"
     qb_number: null, // Will be assigned when synced to QuickBooks
     customer: workOrder.property, // "Palm Court Apartments"
     work_description: workOrder.description, // "Pool pump motor replaced"
     technician: workOrder.technician, // "Rick Jacobs"
     technician_type: "Repair",
     amount: workOrder.amount, // 450.00
     status: "Pending", // or "Draft"
     sent_date: null,
     due_date: calculateDueDate(), // e.g., 30 days from now
     paid_date: null,
     emailed: false,
     wo_number: workOrder.wo_number, // "WO-26-00001"
     line_items: workOrder.line_items,
     photos: workOrder.photos,
     created_at: new Date()
   };
   ```

3. **After creating invoice:**
   - Remove the work order from "Completed Without Approval" container
   - Update the count badge (6 → 5)
   - Add the new invoice to the Invoices table
   - Show success toast: "Invoice INV-26-00018 created for Palm Court Apartments - $450.00"

4. **The new invoice should appear in the Invoices list:**
   - INVOICE #: INV-26-00018
   - QB #: (pending)
   - CUSTOMER/WORK: Palm Court Apartments - 🔧 Pool pump motor replaced
   - TECHNICIAN: Rick Jacobs (Repair)
   - AMOUNT: $450.00
   - STATUS: Pending
   - Include WO reference: WO-26-00001

**MAKE SURE:**
- The API endpoint actually saves the invoice to the database
- The Invoices page fetches and displays the new invoice
- The work order is removed from the Work Order container
- Data persists after page refresh
