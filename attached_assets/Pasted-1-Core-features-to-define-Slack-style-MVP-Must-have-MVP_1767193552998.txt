1) Core features to define (Slack-style MVP)

Must-have (MVP)

Workspaces/Orgs (your company / customer)

Channels (public + private)

Channel membership (join/leave, invite)

Messages (text + basic formatting)

Real-time updates (new message appears instantly)

Search (at least within a channel)

Next (Slack-feel)

Threads (reply-to-message)

Reactions (👍🔥 etc.)

Mentions (@name, @channel)

Read receipts / last read (unread badges)

Files (upload + preview links)

Pinned messages

Roles/Permissions (Owner/Admin/Member/Guest)

2) Recommended architecture (simple + scalable)
Frontend

React / Next.js (web) or React Native (mobile)

A chat UI library helps (but you can custom-build)

Backend (pick one direction)

Option A: Fastest to build

Firebase (Firestore + Auth) + Cloud Functions
Great if you want speed and reliability without heavy backend work.

Option B: More control

Node.js (Nest/Express) or Python (FastAPI)

Real-time via WebSockets (Socket.IO or native WS)

Database: Postgres (recommended) or MongoDB

For scaling: Redis (presence, typing indicators, pub/sub)

3) Data model you’ll need (Slack-like schema)

organizations (workspace)

users

org_members (role, status)

channels (org_id, name, is_private)

channel_members

messages (channel_id, user_id, body, created_at, edited_at)

threads (or: messages.parent_message_id)

reactions (message_id, user_id, emoji)

attachments (message_id, file_url, type, size)

reads (channel_id, user_id, last_read_message_id / timestamp)

That structure alone gets you 80% of Slack.

4) Real-time behavior you’ll implement

When someone posts: server saves message → broadcasts to channel subscribers

Clients subscribe to channels they’re in

Presence (online/away) is optional but “Slack-feel”

Typing indicator: send “typing:start/stop” events (don’t store in DB, keep in memory/Redis)

5) UI layout (Slack-like)

Left sidebar:

Workspace switcher (optional)

Channels list (grouped)

Direct Messages list

Main panel:

Channel header (name, members, topic)

Message list (infinite scroll)

Composer (text + upload + emoji)

Right panel (optional):

Channel info, pins, files, members

6) What I’d build first (your “Version 1” plan)

Workspaces + user auth

Channel create/join + channel list

Post/read messages with real-time updates

Threads (parent_message_id)

Mentions + notifications badge

File uploads

Roles + private channels

7) Quick direction question (so I can give you the exact build plan)

Tell me which stack you’re using right now for your app:

Replit/Node, Python, Firebase, or something else?
And is this for Breakpoint internal only (one company), or multi-tenant (many customers)?
