exact style you typed out.

Let’s do three things:

A template that matches your example.

An example email for that PRESERVE At Chino alert you showed.

A JS function you can run on Replit that builds the bulk email body from data.

1️⃣ Standard template (matches your Alpha Chemical Order style)

Use this shape for every auto-generated order:

From: COO <COO@breakpointpools.com>
Sent: {DayOfWeek}, {Month} {Day}, {Year} {Time}
To: {Vendor Name} <{vendorEmail}>
Cc: {Rep Name} <{repEmail}>
Subject: {Subject Line}

{Account 1 Name}{RushFlag}
{Account 1 Address}
{Account 1 entry / lockbox notes}

{Account 1 chemical line 1}
{Account 1 chemical line 2}
...

{Account 2 Name}{RushFlag}
{Account 2 Address}
{Account 2 entry / lockbox notes}

{Account 2 chemical line 1}
{Account 2 chemical line 2}
...

Warm Regards,

Where {RushFlag} is either blank or " Rush!".

2️⃣ Example built from your PRESERVE At Chino alert

Your card:

Pool
PRESERVE At Chino
150 gallon chlorine tank (below half) | 50 gallon muriatic acid tank (below half)

Here’s what the auto email section for that one account could look like:

From: COO <COO@breakpointpools.com>
Sent: Tuesday, November 25, 2025 8:03 AM
To: Paramount Orders <pmtorder@awspoolsupply.com>
Cc: Jesus Diaz <Jesus@awspoolsupply.com>
Subject: Alpha Chemical Order

PRESERVE At Chino Rush!
[C/O management name + mailing address here]
[Gate/lockbox codes here]

Bulk bleach – refill 150-gallon chlorine tank (currently below half)
Bulk muriatic acid – refill 50-gallon acid tank (currently below half)

Warm Regards,

David Harding Sr
Chief Operating Officer

When you batch multiple alerts, you just stack more property sections under the subject line, like your Amelia / Menifee / Bear Creek example.

3️⃣ Replit automation: build the bulk email body from JSON

On your Replit backend, once you’ve pulled and joined your PoolBrain alerts, convert them into a list like this:

const orders = [
  {
    accountName: "Amelia Square",
    rush: true,
    address: "3332 Wind Chime Lane Perris, CA 92571",
    entryNotes: "Main entry code: #7139\nLockbox: 5090",
    items: [
      "2 – 15gal Bleach",
      "2 – 15gal Acid"
    ]
  },
  {
    accountName: "PRESERVE At Chino",
    rush: true,
    address: "C/O: First Service Residential, LL CPO BOX 62499, IRVINE, CA 92602",
    entryNotes: "Gate/lockbox notes here",
    items: [
      "Bulk bleach – refill 150-gallon tank (currently below half)",
      "Bulk muriatic acid – refill 50-gallon tank (currently below half)"
    ]
  }
  // ...more accounts
];


Now use this function to generate the email text:

function buildChemicalOrderEmail({ orders, vendorName, vendorEmail, repName, repEmail, subject }) {
  const now = new Date();

  const dayName = now.toLocaleDateString("en-US", { weekday: "long" });
  const datePart = now.toLocaleDateString("en-US", {
    month: "long",
    day: "numeric",
    year: "numeric"
  });
  const timePart = now.toLocaleTimeString("en-US", {
    hour: "numeric",
    minute: "2-digit"
  });

  const headerLines = [
    `From: COO <COO@breakpointpools.com>`,
    `Sent: ${dayName}, ${datePart} ${timePart}`,
    `To: ${vendorName} <${vendorEmail}>`,
    `Cc: ${repName} <${repEmail}>`,
    `Subject: ${subject}`,
    "",
  ];

  const bodyLines = [];

  orders.forEach(order => {
    const rushFlag = order.rush ? " Rush!" : "";
    bodyLines.push(`${order.accountName}${rushFlag}`);
    if (order.address) bodyLines.push(order.address);
    if (order.entryNotes) bodyLines.push(order.entryNotes);
    bodyLines.push(""); // empty line before items

    (order.items || []).forEach(item => bodyLines.push(item));
    bodyLines.push(""); // blank line between accounts
  });

  const footerLines = [
    "Warm Regards,",
    "",
    "David Harding Sr",
    "Chief Operating Officer",
    "Direct: 951-312-5060",
    "Office: 951-653-3333 Press 6",
    "https://www.breakpointpools.com"
  ];

  return [...headerLines, ...bodyLines, ...footerLines].join("\n");
}


Usage:

const emailText = buildChemicalOrderEmail({
  orders,
  vendorName: "Paramount Orders",
  vendorEmail: "pmtorder@awspoolsupply.com",
  repName: "Jesus Diaz",
  repEmail: "Jesus@awspoolsupply.com",
  subject: "Alpha Chemical Order"
});

// You now have one big string you can:
// - paste into Outlook
// - send via SMTP / Gmail API / MS Graph from your automation
console.log(emailText);

How this ties to PoolBrain alerts

PoolBrain alert: “150 gallon chlorine tank (below half)”

Your Replit backend:

Reads alert

Maps pool → address, codes

Decides what to order (e.g., refill bulk tank or N x 15gal drums)

Pushes a line into items: []

Call buildChemicalOrderEmail() once per vendor → you get a full, ready-to-send bulk order email in exactly the style you showed.
