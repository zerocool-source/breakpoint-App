Create a customer-service workflow module for a pool service management app. The module should replicate these features:

1. Customer profile page
   - Shows customer status and email.
   - Tabs for “Addresses” and “Contacts”; allow search and add operations.
   - Display tags (e.g., seasonal service frequency).
   - Route stop email field with ability to edit multiple addresses.

2. Route integration
   - A “Route” link with a calendar icon that links to the scheduling board.

3. Bodies of water tabs
   - Horizontal tabs representing different bodies of water (pool, spa, fountain, etc.).
   - Color-coded tabs; user can add, delete, or rename tabs.
   - Switching tabs updates the workflow template fields.

4. Service configuration panel
   - Three fields: “Service Level” (dropdown), “Type” (dropdown), and “Gallons” (numeric input).
   - Changes to these fields update the task list template.

5. Workflow builder
   - Sections for “When Arriving,” “Before Pictures,” “Chemical Readings,” “Chemical Dosing,” and “Job in Progress.”
   - Each section is a collapsible container with a drop zone labeled “Drag items here.”
   - Tasks:
     - Have drag handles for reordering.
     - Include a completion checkbox.
     - Support optional icons (camera, calendar, etc.).
     - Hide automatically when irrelevant (e.g., hidden if the equipment type doesn’t match).
   - A blue “Add Item” link opens a modal to choose from pre-defined tasks and add them to the workflow.

6. Equipment settings
   - Icon buttons at the bottom representing filter type, pump, chlorinator, and heater.
   - Selecting an equipment type influences which tasks appear or are hidden.
   - A “view more” link reveals additional equipment categories.

Technical requirements:
- Use React for the frontend.
- Use state management to store customer details, addresses, contacts, workflow configuration, and equipment types.
- Implement drag-and-drop for tasks and sections.
- Provide a backend stub or mock API to save and load customer data, workflows, and equipment settings.
- Use clear, modular components: `CustomerSidebar`, `ServiceTabs`, `ServiceConfigPanel`, `WorkflowBuilder`, and `EquipmentSelector`.

Focus on replicating the user experience shown in the screenshots, including the ability to reorder tasks, drag-and-drop items between sections, add new bodies of water via tabs, and toggle equipment to conditionally display tasks.
