Let me check the transcript to understand the current implementation and fix the Invoice button functionality.On the "Completed Without Approval (Work Order)" container, fix the Invoice button functionality:

**WHEN CLICKING THE "INVOICE" BUTTON:**

1. **Get selected work orders:**
   - Check which rows have checkboxes selected (e.g., WO-26-00001 Palm Court Apartments is selected)

2. **Create invoice(s) for selected work orders:**
   - Generate new invoice number (e.g., INV-26-00018)
   - Copy work order data to invoice:
     - Customer/Property: Palm Court Apartments
     - Description: Pool pump motor replaced
     - Amount: $450.00
     - Technician: Rick Jacobs
     - WO Number reference: WO-26-00001
     - Line items from work order

3. **Remove from Work Order container:**
   - Remove the selected work order(s) from the "Completed Without Approval" list
   - Update the count badge (6 → 5)

4. **Add to Invoices page:**
   - Create new invoice record in the database
   - Invoice should appear in the Invoices list with:
     - INVOICE #: INV-26-00018
     - QB #: (auto-generate or pending)
     - CUSTOMER/WORK: Palm Court Apartments - Pool pump motor replaced
     - TECHNICIAN: Rick Jacobs (Repair)
     - STATUS: Pending or Draft
     - AMOUNT: $450.00
     - "Work Order" tag to indicate source

5. **Show success feedback:**
   - Display success toast: "Invoice INV-26-00018 created for Palm Court Apartments"
   - Optionally navigate to Invoices page or show link

**FLOW:**
```
[✓] WO-26-00001 | Palm Court Apartments | $450.00
                                            [Invoice (1)] clicked
                                                    ↓
Remove WO-26-00001 from Work Order container
                                                    ↓
Create INV-26-00018 in Invoices table
                                                    ↓
Toast: "Invoice created successfully"
                                                    ↓
Navigate to Invoices page (optional)
```

**MAKE SURE:**
- Selected work orders are removed from the container after invoicing
- New invoice appears in the Invoices list immediately
- Count badge updates correctly
- Invoice contains all the work order data (description, amount, technician, line items, photos)
- WO number is referenced on the invoice for tracking
